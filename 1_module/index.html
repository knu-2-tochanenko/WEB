                        <h1>Etymology</h1>
                        <p>The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine. The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ("the German lands") is derived from deutsch (compare Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc "popular" (i.e. belonging to the diot or diota "people"), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants</p>

                        <h1>History</h1>
                        <p>The discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago. The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen between 1994 and 1998 where eight 380,000-year-old wooden javelins of 1.82 to 2.25 m (5.97 to 7.38 ft) length were unearthed.</p>

                        <h1>Germanic Empire</h1>
                        <p>The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age. From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

                        <h1>Holy Roman Empire</h1>
                        <p>In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the <span class="yellow-selected">Carolingian Empire</span>, which was later divided in 843 among his heirs. Following the break up of the Frankish Realm, for 900 years, the history of Germany was <span class="yellow-selected">intertwined with the history</span> of the Holy Roman Empire, which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original empire</p>

                        <h1>Weimar Republic</h1>
                        <p>Germany was declared a federal republic at the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918, with 18 federated states in 1925. On 11 August 1919 President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution. In the subsequent struggle for power, the radical-left Communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements in other parts of Germany attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch.</p>
